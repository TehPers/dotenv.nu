# QUOTE STYLE #
# ----------- #
# There are several different quote styles for a value. A value can be written
# as an unquoted value or double-quoted value, which both allow variable
# substitutions and escapes within them. There are also single-quoted values
# which do not allow substitutions or escapes.

# Unquoted
UNQUOTED_SIMPLE=this value is unquoted
UNQUOTED_SUB=${UNQUOTED_SIMPLE} and has a substitution

# Single-quoted
SINGLE_QUOTED_SIMPLE='this value is single-quoted'
SINGLE_QUOTED_SUB='${SINGLE_QUOTED_SIMPLE} is not substituted'
SINGLE_QUOTED_MULTILINE='value can
have newlines'

# Double-quoted
DOUBLE_QUOTED_SIMPLE="this value is double-quoted"
DOUBLE_QUOTED_SUB="${DOUBLE_QUOTED_SIMPLE} and has a substitution"
DOUBLE_QUOTED_MULTILINE="value can
have newlines"

################
# SUBSTITUTION #
# ------------ #
# Variables can be substituted into values that aren't single-quoted. To
# substitute a variable into one of these values, either:
#
# - prefix the variable with `$`, for example `$VAR`. All letters following the
#   `$` character will be substituted, but only letters will be treated as being
#   part of the variable name.
# - surround the variable with braces and prefix it all with `$`, for example
#   `${VAR}`. Any valid variable name can be used within the braces.
#
# If a variable is not defined, it expands to an empty string.
#
# Only variables defined earlier in the file can be substituted. This means that
# variable substitutions won't work for variables from the process's
# environment.

A=hello
A123=world
SUB_UNBRACED=$A $A123 # hello hello123
SUB_BRACED=${A} ${A123} # hello world
SUB_EXTERNAL=$PATH is not substituted # ' is not substituted'

############
# COMMENTS #
# -------- #
# Comments start with `#`. As long as `#` isn't in a quoted string and is not
# immediately prefixed with a non-whitespace character (including newlines), all
# text following it until the end of the line is treated as a comment.
#
# For readability, if `#` is intended to be part of a string, it should always
# be in quotes. In all other cases, `#` must not be prefixed by a non-whitespace
# character to be treated as the start of a comment.
#
# Comments are ignored during parsing.

COMMENT_SIMPLE=abc #this is a comment
COMMENT_WITHOUT_WS=abc# this is not a comment # but this is
COMMENT_IN_QUOTES='abc # this is not a comment' # but this is
